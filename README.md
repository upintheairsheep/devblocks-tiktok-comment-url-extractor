A TikTok comment URL extractor that uses the V2 API (replies not supported). Use the tool to phrase, download, archive, or process with the tool of your choice.

Please https://dev-blocks.powerbox1000.repl.co/ to load the project


Note: Extraction of reply urls is not supported due to adacraft being a crybaby when it comes to url security and dev-blocks being a piece of shit because it can't manage JSON objects that well, only a wee bit.
